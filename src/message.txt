We use a Grease-Free Eco-Friendly Cooking system. Super-Heated Convection
Air is used to cook many traditionally fried items such as Hot Wings, Seasoned
Waffle Fries and Battered Cheese Sticks. We serve everything cooked to order
and all items are available for TAKE-OUT. We add new Daily Special items each day.
Hot Meatloaf Dinner, Pasta with Meat Sauce and Garlic Toast, Strawberry Chicken Salad
and Pot Roast are a few of the many items we offer in addition to our regular menu.
