            <h3>Cappys is known for Healthy, Fresh, and Reasonably Priced Food and Drinks.</h3>
            <p>
                We use a Grease-Free Eco-Friendly Cooking system. Super-Heated Convection 
                Air is used to cook many traditionally fried items such as Hot Wings, Seasoned 
                Waffle Fries and Battered Cheese Sticks. We serve everything cooked to order 
                and all items are available for TAKE-OUT. We add new Daily Special items each day. 
                Hot Meatloaf Dinner, Pasta with Meat Sauce and Garlic Toast, Strawberry Chicken Salad 
                and Pot Roast are a few of the many items we offer in addition to our regular menu. 
                Cappy's offers a full breakfast menu every SAT & SUN 10am - 2pm. 
                Gourmet Omelettes, Corned Beef Hash, Pancakes, Raisin Bread French Toast, 
                Egg Whites, Yogurt, Oatmeal and much more. (Try one of our famous Bloody Marys). 
                Stop in and find out what smart Pittsburghers have known for years.
